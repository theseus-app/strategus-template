=================

## Rule-Based Pipeline (StudyDTO -> R -> analysisSpecification.json)

Use this when you want deterministic, non-LLM generation from the gold standard StudyDTO JSON exports.

1) Generate R from a gold standard JSON export:
```
node --experimental-strip-types json2strategus.ts public/goldStandard/default/AntiVEGFKidney.ts --rule-based --output-json generated_json/analysisSpec/antivegfkidneyAnalysisSpecification.json
```
This writes:
- `generated_r/rule_based/antivegfkidney_CreateStrategusAnalysisSpecification_rulebased.R`

2) Run the generated R script to produce the JSON:
```
RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=FALSE \
R_LIBS_USER=renv/library/macos/R-4.5/aarch64-apple-darwin24.4.0 \
Rscript generated_r/rule_based/antivegfkidney_CreateStrategusAnalysisSpecification_rulebased.R
```
This writes:
- `generated_json/analysisSpec/antivegfkidneyAnalysisSpecification.json`

Notes:
- Omit `--output-json` to write to `inst/<studyName>/<studyName>AnalysisSpecification.json`.
- The R script fetches cohort definitions and negative control concepts from `https://atlas-demo.ohdsi.org/WebAPI`, so network access is required.

See the **[Using This Template.md](template_docs/UsingThisTemplate.md)** for more information on how to use this template.

----

An OHDSI study repository is expected to have a README.md file where the header conforms to a standard. A template README file is provided here:

**[README file template](template_docs/templateREADME.md)**

When initiating a repository, please copy this file, rename it to 'README.md', and fill in the fields as appropriate.

The information in the repository README file will be used to automatically update the [list of OHDSI research studies](https://data.ohdsi.org/OhdsiStudies/), so it is important to fill in the template accurately, and keep it up-to-date.

## Elements in the README template

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Study title]      | A meaningful title of the research project.            
| Study status badge | A badge indicating the study status. See [below](#study-status) for valid options. |
| Analytics use case | One or more analytics use cases included in the study (in a comma-separated list). See [below](#analytics-use-cases) for valid options. |
| Study type | The type of study. See [below](#study-types) for valid options. |
| Tags | Zero, one, or more additional keywords that can be used to filter the list of studies. The list of tags is not restricted, but be conservative in making up new tags. For example: `EHDEN` to identify studies that are part of the [EHDEN project](https://www.ehden.eu/). |
| Study lead | The name of the study lead.|
| Study lead forums tag | The OHDSI forums tag of the study lead, which can be used to contact the lead. It is recommended to make this a hyperlink to lead's forums profile |
| Study start date | When did work on the study commence? This date typically indicates when development of the protocol was initiated. Format: [Month] [Day], [Year] (e.g. May 1, 2019)|
| Study end date | When was the study completed? This typically indicates when the analyses were completed and the results have been collected. Do not enter future (planned) dates here. Format: [Month] [Day], [Year] (e.g. May 1, 2019)| 
| Protocol | A hyperlink to the protocol. The protocol is expected to be a document in the study repository itself. | 
| Publications | Zero, one or more hyperlinks to papers produced as part of the study (comma-separated). | 
| Results explorer | A hyperlink to a web app (e.g. a Shiny app) where the results of the study can be explored. |

### Study Status

Choose one of the following options:

| Badge             | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Study%20Status-Repo%20Created-lightgray.svg" alt="Study Status: Repo Created"> | The study repository has just been created. Work has not yet commenced. | 
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Study%20Status-Started-blue.svg" alt="Study Status: Started"> | A first commit was made (to something else than the README file). Work has commenced. |
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Study%20Status-Design%20Finalized-brightgreen.svg" alt="Study Status: Design Finalized"> | The protocol and study code have been finalized. | 
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Study%20Status-Results%20Available-yellow.svg" alt="Study Status: Results Available"> | The study results are publicly available, for example in a paper or results explorer app. | 
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Study%20Status-Complete-orange.svg" alt="Study Status: Complete"> | The study is complete, no further dissemination planned. | 
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Study%20Status-Suspended-red.svg" alt="Study Status: Suspended"> | The study has been suspended, and may or may not be continued at a later point in time. | 

Copy the relevant markdown code from [this page](badgesMarkdownCode.md), and paste it in your README file, just below the study title.

### Analytics Use Cases

Choose one or more options from: 

- `Characterization`
- `Population-Level Estimation`, or
- `Patient-Level Prediction` 

See [the Data Analytics Use Cases chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/DataAnalyticsUseCases.html) for more details.

### Study types

Can be either:

- `Methods Research` if the study explores a methodological question, for example an evaluation of various propensity score approaches. 
- `Clinical Application` if the study aims to answer a clinically relevant question, for example 'Does drug A cause outcome B?'.
